## 10 final project

Training Dean

The final project I created for the Iron Yard is named Training Dean. Training Dean is a coaching staffs secret weapon by updating their training schedules at a moments notice. Users input or upload their training sessions to reference later with the use of wunderground's weather API for up to the moment weather conditions.  I used MVC architecture for the front-end user experience (Backbone, React). User data including user auth, information, ordered items were saved to Parse Dashboard. Weather data was obtained through restful API requests to Wunderground API.  This site is hosted on github.

Tech: HTML/CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Backbone, React, Restful API (JSON), Heroku
